# Split-Array-Largest-Sum
Given an array nums which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays.  Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.

CONSTRAINTS:
1 <= nums.length <= 1000

0 <= nums[i] <= 106

1 <= m <= min(50, nums.length)
